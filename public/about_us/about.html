								Being someone who doesn’t like crowded places ( or a bad headphone) , Nabil defines himself as an introvert. As most of his interests are tech-related, he often finds himself staring at a computer screen more and socializing less - something he wouldn’t change for the world. Nabil taught himself HTML and CSS in 9th grade and started making personal websites. Later, he moved towards harder things like Javascript, C++ and Python through something books and ‘trial and error’ which is basically short for - face a problem, google it, google it again and then fix the problem. He wishes to get good enough to work for tech giants like Google or Microsoft or some place where he can work with actually passionate and dedicated people to be a part of making something big.

								He started working for the R-Squared Project mainly because its potential and dedication to strive for greatness. Even though it may seem like his world revolves only around electronics and computers, Nabil has goals of his own. He wants to bring changes in the mindset of people and broaden their views, and he has a strong belief this project can help him achieve that.
